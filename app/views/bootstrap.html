<h3>What is the code doing?</h3>

<code><span class="pln">ng-app</span></code>directive:
<pre prettyprint>
<xmp><html ng-app></xmp>
</pre>
<p>
	The <code><span class="pln">ng-app</span></code> attribute represents an Angular directive named <code><span class="pln">ngApp</span></code> (Angular uses <code><span class="pln">spinal-case</span></code> for its custom attributes and <code><span class="pln">camelCase</span></code> for the corresponding directives which implement them). This directive is used to flag the html element that Angular should consider to be the root element of our application. This gives application developers the freedom to tell Angular if the entire html page or only a portion of it should be treated as the Angular application.
</p>
<code><span class="pln">angular</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">js</span></code>

AngularJS script tag:
<pre prettyprint>
<xmp><script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script></xmp>
</pre>
<p>This code downloads the <code><span class="pln">angular.js</span></code> script and registers a callback that will be executed by the browser when the containing HTML page is fully downloaded. When the callback is executed, Angular looks for the ngApp directive. If Angular finds the directive, it will bootstrap the application with the root of the application DOM being the element on which the ngApp directive was defined.</p>

Double-curly binding with an expression:
<pre prettyprint>
Nothing here {{'yet' + '!'}}
</pre>

<p>
This line demonstrates the core feature of Angular's templating capabilities â€“ a binding, denoted by double-curlies {{ }} as well as a simple expression <code><span class="pln">'yet' + '!'</span></code> used in this binding.
</p>
<p>
The binding tells Angular that it should evaluate an expression and insert the result into the DOM in place of the binding. Rather than a one-time insert, as we'll see in the next steps, a binding will result in efficient continuous updates whenever the result of the expression evaluation changes.
</p>
<p>
Angular expression is a JavaScript-like code snippet that is evaluated by Angular in the context of the current model scope, rather than within the scope of the global context (<code><span class="pln">window</span></code>).
</p>
<p>
As expected, once this template is processed by Angular, the html page contains the text: "Nothing here yet!".
